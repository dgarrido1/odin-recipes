    <h3>An incredible Hawaiian dish that you MUST try in your life!</h3>
    <p>It has eggs, beef patties, rice, and gravy! How can you go wrong?</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 (12 oz) jar brown gravy</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Divide ground chuck into 4 equal portions; form into patties.</li>
        <li>Fry patties in skillet until beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Remove patties to a plate, retaining drippings in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Stir onion and water into the reserved drippings. Reduce heat to low and cook until the onions are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Stir mushrooms into the onion mixture; cook until mushrooms are cooked through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Pour gravy over the onion and mushroom mixture; stir. Cook until the gravy is hot, about 5 minutes. Gently lie patties into the gravy; simmer until reheated through.</li>
        <li>While the patties simmer in gravy, prepare a separate skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Fry eggs in the hot skillet until the white is opaque but the yolk remains runny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide rice between 4 plates. Top each rice portion with a beef patty and top the patties each with an egg. Pour gravy equally over each portion.</li>
    </ol>
