    <h3>How about a Hawaiian Dessert?! Another must try!</h3>
    <p>Delicious Hawaiian bread that anyone will love--even those who don't like coconut! Eat it for dessert or with any meat hot off the grill. Tastes great warm or cool.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package frozen dinner rolls, thawed</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray. Coat your hands with cooking spray or shortening, and roll the dough balls in your hands so that they have a light coating. Place in the prepared dish. Set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled, up to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together the coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk and sugar. Pour this mixture over the top of the rolls as evenly as you can.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes before separating and serving.</li>
    </ol>
